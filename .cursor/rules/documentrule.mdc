Preserve Non-Text Elements

Do not remove or change the paths of images, charts, or media files.

Do not modify XML tags or JSON keys for media. Keep them exactly as they are.

Keep tables’ cell structure intact; only change text content inside cells.

Maintain Document Structure

Headings can be renamed, merged, or split, but keep their heading level (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) the same unless explicitly told otherwise.

Always keep sections in valid hierarchical order (Heading 1 → Heading 2 → Heading 3…).

When Renaming or Merging Sections

Keep the section IDs and tags intact; only replace their text content.

If merging two sections, combine their content under one heading and delete the extra heading tag without disturbing the XML/JSON structure.

Content Editing

You may rewrite sentences for clarity.

You may rearrange paragraphs inside a section if needed.

Keep placeholders for data (like {Table1} or {Image1}) unchanged.

Formatting Rules

Do not delete <w:p>, <w:tbl>, <w:tr>, or <w:tc> tags in XML (or their JSON equivalents).

Do not insert raw text outside of <w:t> tags (or text fields in JSON).

Output Rules

Always produce a complete, valid JSON/XML structure that can be converted back into a .docx without errors.
